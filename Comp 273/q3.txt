Question 3:

The recusrsive method use a lot of memory compare to the iterative one
Just to save the register in the stack, the recursive method use n-time more memory(where n is number of time the recusrion is called).
Its logic that the cache will have more miss as we are trying to store more stuff.
By increasing the size of the cache block we can reduce the misses.
The use of associative mapping reduce also the amount of miss.( As 1-way is similar to direct-cache)
