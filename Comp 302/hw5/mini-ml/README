To run the code : 

Start a SML interpreter, and type: 
  CM.make "sources.cm";

This will compiler your code.

We provide three top-level functions to pretty print expressions, evaluate expressions and verify that they are closed. 

Top.file_print "<path-to-file>";

  Pretty prints the expression in the file <path-to-file>

Top.file_eval "<path-to-file>";

  Evaluates the expression in the file <path-to-file> to a value.

Top.file_type "<path-to-file>";

  Infers the type of the expression in the file <path-to-file>.
