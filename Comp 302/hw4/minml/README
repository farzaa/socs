To read and print expressions you can use the following functions defined in
top.sml

(* interactive loop *)
val loop_print           : unit -> unit   (* read in a string and  prints it back)
val loop_print_deBruijn  : unit -> unit   (* read in an expression, converts it
                                             to deBruijn representation and
					     prints it back *)
val loop_print_closed    : unit -> unit   (* read in a string, check that it
                                             does not contain any free variables and print it back *)
val loop_print_deBruijn_closed : unit -> unit
                                           (* read in a string, convert it to
					   deBruijn and check that the resulting
					   term is closed *)

(* read a MinML source file *)
val file_print          : string -> unit
val file_print_deBruijn : string -> unit
