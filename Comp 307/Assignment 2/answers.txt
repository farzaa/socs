Comp 307 - Assignment 2 - Q1 - Project

Team: Andrew Gowing, Timothee Guerin, Alexandre Olivier (Beloved Leader)

Description: We would like to create a website that recommends recipes according to the ingredients a user would like to use. The main idea is to have a drag and drop interface with icons corresponding to ingredients and drop those icons in some kind of kitchen/pot/pan or something else. Then, the website would provide a list of recipes using only those ingredients.

Technology: To do so, we will be using the following 4 technologies.
	MySQL for the ingredients and recipe database
HTML 5+CSS
Javascript
Rails (If allowed of course)
