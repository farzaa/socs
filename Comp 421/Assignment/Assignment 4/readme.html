  <h1>Assignment 4: Hadoop and Pig</h1>
<h4>Due date: Friday, March 11, 23:59 </h4>
</div>

Note that you do this assignment 4 in the groups that  you have
created for your project. Although it&#39;s officially a group assignment
where you only upload one solution per group, I recommend that you all do the assignment individually to
practice working with the Amazon cloud.

<p>

Note: The setup and help information for this assignment was taken
from the Homework 6 of the Fall
2012 term of CSE 344 of University of Washington (<a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/education/courses/cse344/12au/hw/hw6/hw6.html"> http://www.cs.washington.edu/education/courses/cse344/12au/hw/hw6/hw6.html)</a>

<h2>Setup Instructions your Pig Cluster</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>AMAZON CODES:</strong> You should have received your Amazon code by email. Please email the TA or instructor if you did not get the code. <p></p></li>
<li><p> Follow the instructions given in AWSsetupandusage in the A3
module of mycourses to setup the cluster. NOTE: It will take you a good <strong>60 minutes</strong>
 to go through all these instructions without even trying to run 
example.pig at the end. But they are worth it. You are learning how to 
use the Amazon cloud, which is by far the most popular cloud today! At 
the end, the instructions will refer to <em>example.pig</em>. This is
the name of the sample program that we will run in the next
step.</p></li>

<h2> Information about the data used in this assignment </h2>

The data used in this assignment is the record of federal elections for MPs in Canadian
House of Commons since 1867. The original source can be found at:
http://data.gc.ca/data/en/dataset/ea8f2c37-90b6-4fee-857e-984d3060184e.
The complete data set has already been loaded on S3 at s3n://electiondata421/data2.csv.
Note that some modifications have been made to the original data to allow more precise
schema declarations.
<br/>
Each entry in the file has the following fields in order:
<ol>
  <li>  The date of the election.
</li><li> The election type (either Gen or B/P for by-election).
</li><li> The number of the Parliament session.
</li><li> Province where the election took place.
</li><li> Electoral district.
</li><li> Last name of the candidate.
</li><li> First name of the candidate.
</li><li> Gender (F, otherwise either M or &#39;&#39;).
</li><li> Occupation of the candidate.
</li><li> Party of the candidate.
</li><li> Number of votes received.
</li><li> Percentage of total votes.
</li><li> Whether the candidate won (Elected = 1, Defeated = 0).
</li></ol>

  When the data is loaded, you should define the schema so that the columns can be referred
to by name. Also, datatypes are defined here to avoid unnecessarily casting every time the
value is used.

<p>

raw = LOAD &#39;s3n://electiondata421/data2.csv&#39; USING PigStorage(&#39;,&#39;) AS
(date, type:chararray, parl:int, prov:chararray,
riding:chararray, lastname:chararray, firstname:chararray,
gender:chararray, occupation:chararray, party:chararray,
votes:int, percent:double, elected:int) ;

<h2>Qestion 0: When was Stephen Harper first elected to
Parliament? (0 Points)</h2>

The goal of this task is to successfully set up and run the Pig cluster. After going through the
setup instructions, you will run the file example.pig ( provided for
in the module a4 on mycourses). This script will load the data from S3,
choose only the records pertaining to Stephen Harper and return the one with the smallest
date. You are going to run the file by pasting it into the interactive
grunt shell.
<p>
The script will take a few minutes to run.
<p>
At the end, you should see totals for how many records were read in and out and a tuple right
above the prompt that looks like this: (1993-10-25 00:00:00, Harper, Stephen).
Run the following line to see how the results relation was generated: illustrate results;.

<p>
<span style="color: red;"> You do not need to submit anything for this
question. </span>




<br/>
</p><h2>Question 1:  Which candidates have won with
over 60% of the vote? (20 Points)</h2>
<p>
Modify the example.pig file to answer this question.
<p>

First, change the filter statement to eliminate rows with percentages less than 60.
<p>

Then replace the foreach directive with: gen = foreach fltrd generate CONCAT(firstname,
CONCAT(&#39; &#39;, lastname);.

<p>
Last, eliminate duplicates using DISTINCT. You should remove the ordering and limiting
directives and then store the results into one of your S3 buckets.

<p><b>What you need to turn in:</b><br/>
  <span style="color: red;"> Submit your script as Q1_script.pig..

<h2>Question 2: Find the closest election margins in history where over 100 votes were
cast for each candidate. (20 Points)</h2>

Start by eliminating all candidates with less than 100 votes.
<p>
Split the relation into those who won and those who lost.
<p>
Join the all the candidates back together and make tuples with the last names of both
candidates (elected and defeated) and the difference between their vote totals. Include only
tuples where the difference is less than 10.
<p>
Store the results in S3.

<p> Run your script on a cluster with 1 master node and 2 core nodes and answer the questions
below:
<ul>
 (a) How many Maps and Reduces are generated in each job? <p>
 (b) What does the schema look like just after the join? <p>
 (c) How long did the query run?
</p></p></ul>


  <span style="color: red;">Submit your script as Q2_script.pig and
 answers in: pig_answers2.txt.
</span></p>

<h2>Question 3: How many members added between each Parliament? (20 Points)</h2>

Consider only general election winners. Dump to the screen a list of (Parliament, count)
tuples showing the difference between that Parliament and the previous one sorted ascending
by Parliament number.
<p>

Answer the following question:
<ul>
   (a) What does the schema look like immediately after the group
  by? Is is nested or flat? <p>
   (b) How long did your query run?
</p></ul>

  <span style="color: red;">Submit your script as Q3_script.pig and
 answers in: pig_answers3.txt.
</span></p>

  
<h2>Question 4: For each Parliament, how many members were of each party?
You will. (20 Points)</h2>

You will use the PigStorage function to generate a CSV file where each line has the
Parliament number, the party name and the number of MPs from that party, along with the
total number of MPs in that Parliament. The file need not be sorted. Write the query in any
way you please.

<p>

  <span style="color: red;">Submit your script as Q4_script.pig.
</span></p>

<h2>Question 5 (on a different data set): How many words
were scanned from 1990? (20 Points) </h2>

For the last question, you will be using a 1 GB sample from the Google Ngrams dataset. The
each record has three values (word, year, number of occurences). The data is stored as a
CSV file here: &#39;s3n://googleNgramsSample/ngrams421.csv&#39;.

<p>
You have to write a script that answers the following question: How many words
were scanned from 1990?

<p>
The script should dump the result to the screen.

<p>

  <span style="color: red;">Submit your script as Q5_script.pig 
</span></p>
