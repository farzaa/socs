Can be run with 1 or two args
Arg1: (Optional)   
    "-sync"   : Use sync method
    "-nosync" : Don't
    none: default sync
Arg2: (Optional or Require arg1)  
    n       : number of product producer
    none    : default 50

=====================
No sync table:
=====================
N       Prod    Cons
10      100     70     
20      200     140
50      500     350
100     1000    700

Here we notice its only 7 cons out of 10 produce, 
however the result is not always the same sometimes(depend when we are running it)

We resilse that the consumed element are a multiple of N all the time.
That probably mean the consumer has not the time to consume any production of k parent.
